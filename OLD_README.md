# ShiftExporter
For target sufferees to get their shifts onto their google calendar like they should have been able to years ago

for windows and linux users:

get the python (should be version 3.7)
get pip (it comes with python, i think you just have to run python get-pip.py)
use pip to get datetime, the google calender api, and selenium

change the information in the source code to your own information (i tried to leave notes to help)

for mac users:
I'm sorry i really don't know anything about Mac/Apple OS
i'm sure it's a similar process and google can help
